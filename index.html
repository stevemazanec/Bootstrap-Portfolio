                    As our world becomes increasingly connected and dependent on the internet, I wanted to learn more about how it all fit together,
                    so I decided to learn to become a web developer. It's challenging but rewarding to peak behind the curtain
                    and learn how these things work. One of the coolest things about it is that the more I learn about it,
                    the more I discover there is to learn about it!
                    <br>
                    <br> When I'm not working on code, I love cheering on the Indians, Cavs, and (painfully) even the Browns.
                    I've had the privilege of attending 2 World Series games, 1 NBA finals game, but never a Super Bowl.
                    Needless to say, it may be awhile until I get to check that one off of my bucket list. I'm also a big
                    fan of running, as I find it's a great way to stay healthy and relieve stress. I've completed four half
                    marathons and hope to run more in the future. One of my favorite things about running is that the competition
                    and the drive are all internal. I'm only competing against myself and my previous fastest times, so motivation
                    is a huge key to succeeding.
